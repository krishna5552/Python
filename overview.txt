1) Python Interpreter:

    Once Python is installed, you can access the Python interpreter, which allows you to execute Python code
interactively. It provides a prompt where you can type Python statements or run scripts saved in files with
a .py extension.

2) Basic Syntax:

    Python uses indentation and whitespace to define code blocks, which sets it apart from other languages
that use curly braces or keywords. It promotes code readability and enforces consistent indentation.

3) Data Types: 

    Python has several built-in data types, including:

    1) Numeric Types: Integers (int) and floating-point numbers (float).
    2) Boolean Type: Represents truth values, either True or False.
    3) Strings: Sequences of characters enclosed in single or double quotes (str).
    4) Lists: Ordered collections of items (list).
    5) Tuples: Immutable collections of items (tuple).
    6) Dictionaries: Key-value pairs (dict).
    7) Sets: Unordered collections of unique items (set).

4) Variables and Operators:

    In Python, you can assign values to variables using the assignment operator (=). Python supports a variety
of operators, including arithmetic, comparison, logical, and more.

Control Flow: Python provides control flow structures to make decisions and repeat code blocks:

5) Conditional Statements: 

    if, elif, and else statements to perform actions based on conditions.

    Loops: for and while loops to iterate over sequences or execute code repeatedly until a condition is met.

6) Functions:

    Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. In Python, you can define functions
using the def keyword. Functions can have parameters (inputs) and return values.

7) Modules and Packages:

    Python offers a vast array of modules and packages that extend its functionality. Modules are single files
containing Python code, whereas packages are directories of modules. You can import modules or specific objects
from them to use their functionalities in your code.

    Group of functions ==> Module(a file) 
    Group of modules   ==> Packages 

8) Exception Handling:

    Python allows you to handle exceptions using the try, except, else, and finally keywords. It helps you
gracefully manage errors and exceptions that may occur during program execution.

9) File Handling:

    Python provides built-in functions and libraries to read from and write to files. You can open files in
different modes (r, w, a, etc.) and perform various operations on them.

10) Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

    Python supports OOP principles, including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. You can define
classes, create objects (instances), and interact with them using methods and attributes.

11) Libraries and Frameworks:

    Python boasts a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, such as NumPy, pandas, TensorFlow, Django,
Flask, and many more. These powerful tools help developers tackle specific tasks efficiently, ranging from
scientific computing to web development.
