Variables:

    Variables are used to store and manipulate data in Python.
    
    A variable is essentially a named location in the computer's memory where data is stored.
    
    It allows us to assign values to names and use those names to refer to the stored values later in the
    program.

Data Types:

    Python has several built-in data types, which define the kind of data that a variable can store.
    
    The common data types in Python include:
    
        Numeric types:

            Integer (int): Represents whole numbers without decimal points.

            Floating-Point (float): Represents real numbers with decimal points.

        Text type:

            String (str): Represents a sequence of characters, enclosed in single or double quotes.

        Sequence types:

            List (list): Represents an ordered collection of items, enclosed in square brackets and separated
            by commas.

            Tuple (tuple): Represents an ordered, immutable collection of items, enclosed in parentheses and 
            separated by commas.

        Mapping type:

            Dictionary (dict): Represents a collection of key-value pairs, enclosed in curly braces.
                               Each key is unique and associated with a value.

        Boolean type:

            Boolean (bool): Represents the truth values True and False.

        Other types:

            NoneType (None): Represents the absence of a value.


Type Conversion:

    Type conversion, also known as typecasting, refers to the process of converting the data from one data
    type to another.
    
    Python provides built-in functions that allow you to perform type conversion as needed.
    
    Here are some common type conversion functions:

        int(): Converts a value to an integer type.
        float(): Converts a value to a floating-point type.
        str(): Converts a value to a string type.
        list(): Converts a sequence to a list type.
        tuple(): Converts a sequence to a tuple type.
        dict(): Converts a sequence of key-value pairs to a dictionary type.

It's important to note that not all types can be converted to each other directly.
For example, converting a string that doesn't represent a valid integer to an integer will result in a
ValueError.
So, it's necessary to handle type conversion carefully and consider data validity.
